# CarShare App

The goal of CarShare is to reduce the number of **car trips**, and therefore **gas usage**, and provide an **efficient** and **organized** way for people to share a car. 

Users of a realm (i.e., those who share a car) can reserve times and record their traveled mileage. The main page of the app displays a dashboard and calendar, where a user may view their realm's stats and/or plan trips. 

Realm stats will include information such as:
- Percentage of gas tank the current user has used
- Number of trips per user
- Upcoming trips

App utilizes React.js, calendar api, mySQL database, frontend + backend development.
